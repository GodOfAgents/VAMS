## [1.0.0-icn] - 2026-04-09

### Added
- **Multi-DA Performance Anchor:** Implemented `da/PerformanceAnchor` to natively anchor SLAs to Celestia, Polygon DA, and EigenDA, providing hardware transparency.
- **Resource Composition Engine:** Created `composer/VAMSComposer` to automatically package compute requests into matching Blueprint profiles against available nodes.
- **Master Hybrid Escrow Model:** Deployed `ComposedSettlement.sol` replacing point-to-point escrows with atomic multi-party payments for orchestrated nodes.
- **Regional Dynamic Emissions:** Launched `RegionAwareDEC.sol` and `RegionalIncentives.sol` to align inflation rewards with geographic under-served capacity, reducing datacenter centralization.
- **Service Block Registry:** Created `registry/ServiceBlockRegistry.sol` enabling builders to package verified code execution environments and earn up to 50% revenue share.
- **Sentinel Enforcer Loop:** Added `sentinel/SLAEnforcer` module executing probabilistic slashing queries based on verifiable downtime logs.
- Added extensive Documentation: `docs/API_REFERENCE.md`, `docs/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md`, `docs/team/ARCHITECTURE_v0-4-0.md`.

### Changed
- Converted monolithic `neuron/` Python backend into independent modular logic layers: `da/`, `composer/`, `economics/`, `services/`, `sentinel/`.
- Updated `gateway/server.py` to route modular endpoints across `/da`, `/composer`, `/economics`, `/services`, `/sentinel`.
- Unified the smart contract structure under `contracts/src/` with clear stratifications: `da/`, `economic/`, `infrastructure/`, `sentinel/`.
- Relicensed the codebase to emphasize open verifiable logic.

### Deprecated
- `VAMS_BountyEscrow` is fully deprecated. Use `ComposedSettlement`.
- The older Static Inflation schedules inside the token contract are deprecated for dynamic emissions (`RegionAwareDEC.sol`).
- Monolithic agent tasks are formally deprecated in favor of Composed Blueprints.

### Removed
- Legacy static `SLA` configurations which have been centralized in the multi-da anchor logs.
